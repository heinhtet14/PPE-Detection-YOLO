For PPE detection (pytorch 17 classes SODA dataset)

### ppe_detection_detector.py

please start at function def detector() ==> return x ==> [p1, p2, c, f"{conf:.2f}"]

task! 

1) saparate workers classes to make ID 
def saparate(x): 
	# x from function detector
	# To saparate workers classes
	'
	'
	'
	'

	x1 = worker
	x2 = 5classes or anothers

     return x1, x2

2) checking equipments for one worker by IOU, and decision that worker are pass or notpass
def decision_sorker(x1, x2) 
	# x_form_saparate = x1 
	# data_five_classes = x2 
	
	
	for x1_ in x1: 
	   for x2_ in x2
	 if IOUx1_ , x2_ ) >= 0.6:
		 '
		 '
		 '
		 decision_pass = [id_worker,  ]
		 return decision_pass 
	 else: 
		 decision_not_pass = [id_worker, ]
	   	 return decision_not_pass 

	# note    [id_worker, vest, hardhat, boot, glove]
	# such as [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, not_pass]
	# if you want show only vest and hardhat , make conditions for this such as vest=true, hardhat=true, boot=false, glove=flase => [2,1,1,0,0]
	

3) drawing box
def draw_box(decision_pass , decision_not_pass ): 
	for i in decision_pass :
		#drawing boxx
		.
		.
		.
	for i in decision_not_pass :
		#drawing boxx
		.
		.
		.
	# use Opencv
